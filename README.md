# Sploding-Star-Animation

Initial solution is a hack and does not use Core Animation.

Bezier paths are drawn to each layer.

An array of layer is used to add the layers to the main view layer; and with a delay to give the illusion of animation.

A complete core animation implementation has been added.

Added a random particle generator for core animation implementation.
